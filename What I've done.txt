- Read in accept data
- Clean accept data (ie: not everything is a string)
- Read in reject data
- Clean reject data
- Remove useless columns from both data sources
- Generate histograms for loan amounts
- Generate histograms for annual income
    - Histograms sucked, turns out people with reported incomes of over 1 million need loans too
- Generate histograms of annual income for all but the 1000 richest applicants
- Generate histograms of open accounts
- Generate histograms of loan request vs loan provided (ie: was the loan request fully satisfied).
    - Yeah, for the most part loans were fully satisfied. Data uninteresting
- Nobody applied for a loan from Maine or North Dakota
- Generate histograms of states
     - As we'd expect, more populated states have higher applications
     - Normalized the histograms based on state population
- Tried clustering Risk scores for rejection. Decided there's enough data for each risk score to be treated independently
- Generated normalized historgrams for state
- Decided to clean up data for both accept and reject to only have data from the years 2012 and 2013. There are 10x
  as many rejections as there are acceptances.
- Updated file loading to load cleaned data. This is way faster and lets us keep track of the data
- doing kmeans is "easy" now
- tried make a decision tree classifier for loan_status. Most of the entires have a loan_status of current and thus
    the results weren't promising. Acheived 70% accuracy but most of that was from correcly classifying the ~65000
    "current" entries correctly
- tried making a decision tree for risk_score of rejected loans. 27% accuracy with depth of 12 and clustering scores into
    10 clusters. Will try more depths. Depth 8 was best

-extracting specific columns (funds requests, emp_title, annual income, reason for loan)
    - using these columns to do some apriori pattern mining    - put the loan and income values into 'bin' of intervals of 1000
        - this will aide in the groupings of the data
    - generated rules based on the 4 columns listed above
