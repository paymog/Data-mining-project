- Read in accept data
- Clean accept data (ie: not everything is a string)
- Read in reject data
- Clean reject data
- Remove useless columns from both data sources
- Generate histograms for loan amounts
- Generate histograms for annual income
    - Histograms sucked, turns out people with reported incomes of over 1 million need loans too
- Generate histograms of annual income for all but the 1000 richest applicants
- Generate histograms of open accounts
- Generate histograms of loan request vs loan provided (ie: was the loan request fully satisfied).
    - Yeah, for the most part loans were fully satisfied. Data uninteresting
- Nobody applied for a loan from Maine or North Dakota
- Generate histograms of states
     - As we'd expect, more populated states have higher applications
     - Normalized the histograms based on state population
